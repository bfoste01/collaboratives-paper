#Articles

The following document reflects some of my initial thoughts about articles I am encountering as I am immersing myself, once again, in the collaborative literature. Each article/chapter/commentary is introduced with it's BibDesk key. 

**barile2012multilevel**:

* There is no meta-theoretical or even midlevel-theoretical references in this work. Instead, the author is staying really close to the results from previous coalition studies (i.e., this is related to this, etc.). This is not a bad thing, but has me thinking that something I can add to my work is some kind of nod to the importance of scientific paradigms, and what these theoretical orientations open up. 
* Heavy use of the coalition's *Theory of Change* as a way of justifying dimensional selection/understanding of the data at hand. This fits well with how I think about this, and have written about it. 
* A major point of this article is to examine the factor structure of the dimensions of collaboration, and to do so in a multilevel SEM framework.  However, one could also argue that if the Theory of Change drives you to select dimensions of coalition functioning, then your indicators will always be so specific that your results simply cannot generalize.
* A critical thing this study ignores is that a multilevel model will allow you to see variation in the nested levels, but the factor structure has to be the same at level 1. The study doesn't violate this explicitly, but it's making the multilevel model sound like it's doing more than it is in the context of this study. 
* Most of these studies examined measurement structure at the individual level without accounting for nesting of observations (Jasuja et al. 2005; Kumpfer et al. 1993; Valente et al. 2007), another surveyed only collaborative directors (Thomson et al. 2007), and others have aggregated data to the setting level and then examined measurement structure.
* "MCFA accounts for the nested structure of the data (i.e., the non- independence of observations within collaboratives) ..." Nice.
* "MCFA is superior to single level latent factor modeling of collaboration because it accounts for the unreliability of individual level reports of collaborative level constructs (Mehta and Neale 2005), providing more accurate and precise estimates of associations at the collaborative level..." Nice. 
* Article pushes really hard for reliable ad valid measures of collaboration. SEM will buy you some cache on the reliable front, but you still have to grapple with construct validity and content validity (at least as it pertains to . If you presuppose measures onto the collaborative, keeping in mind it is the collaborative's theory of change that is driving your dimensional selection, then you are biting off your own hand on the theoretical front. In the case of this paper things are a bit better because the survey was created from the collaborative's *Standards of Excellence.* However, how involved were the members in setting up these standards? Presumably if the ecological validity of your measure rests on these standards all the members feel the standards are valid? They later describe using the partnerships definitions as a limitation of the study.
* Highlights the point of multiple perspectives in evaluation a coalition. Why? E.g., Staff rates all dimensions they deal with daily higher than people who don't do those tasks. 
* Analyses: initially tried to replicate the structure of the survey as the collaborative saw it, then had to parse down and settle on 5 factors, different from what the survey was supposed to measure (keep in mind researchers didn't develop this survey).  What does this mean in the context of developing community specific measures, if the community specific measures breakdown at the factor level? In an applied setting it means people aren't measuring what they think they are measuring. While we know what this means statistically, there are many things
* Results: Taken together, findings from the four models suggest that there are likely multiple semi-independent dimensions of community col- laboration that may also serve as indicators of a higher- order collaborative functioning factor
* Results: we found five dis- tinct dimensions of collaborative functioning: participatory planning process, internal communication, leadership effectiveness, family involvement, and budgeting
* Results: These five distinct dimensions of collaborative functioning have previously been identified as aspects of collaborative functioning and linked to intermediate out- comes such as member satisfaction, engagement, and per- ceived effectiveness (Butterfoss et al. 1996; Florin et al. 2000; Gottlieb et al. 1993; Hays et al. 2000; Kegler et al. 1998; Kumpfer et al. 1993; Riggs et al. 2008; Rogers and Howard-Pitney 1993; Weiss et al. 2002; Shortell et al. 2002; Zakocs and Guckenburg 2007).
* Results: Furthermore, according to the Partnershipâ€™s Theory of Change they are thought to be the means by which collaboratives manage the challenges of interorganizational collaboration to obtain its benefits, including coordinated services and increase public awareness of targeted issues in the inter- mediate term, and improved outcomes for children and families ultimately.
* Should a meta-theory generalize to smaller colalboratives?
